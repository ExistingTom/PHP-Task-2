PHP Test
=======
Welcome to your final test. The web pages that you will build must look exactly like the screenshots (with minor changes to colors, ui, etc). The program is a simple web page that allows children to log in to the site, and practice their times tables (e.g. 1 x 1 = 1, 1 x 2 = 2, 4 x 4 = 12, etc..)

## Step 1: Logging in ##
There are three children (users): Anne, Georgia and John, who are 5, 6 and 7 years old, respectively.

The username for each one of the above users, is the same as the first name. The password will be exactly like the username, but with a '1' at the end. For example John's username would be `john` and his password would be: `john1`.. The same goes for the rest of the users.

Build a login page, with a small form **IN THE CENTRE** of the page. The form should look like the following:

## Step 2: Showing numbers ##
Once a user logs in with their username and password, they'll be directed to a page with 10 numbers.

Since Anne is the youngest, she will see the 1x table:

Goergia is older than Anne.. she will see the 10x table:

And finally since John is the oldest, he will see the 100x table.

## Step 3: Showing Colors ##

As you may have noticed in the above screenshots, female users (Georgia & Anne), have pink-colored text, whilst the male user (John) has a blue-colored text. 

Please make sure your webpage does this too.

## Step 4: A Random User  ##

Create another user (other than John, Georgia and Anne), whose username is `random` and password is `random1`.

The scope of this user, is to log in and be able to see a **10x table** with each number being in a different color or hue:
